# Bash_Security_Suite
My first bash script to learn scripting and command line function

This was my first scripting project, that I completed as a hobbyist in my own time.

The idea was to create an easy to use, intuitive Bash script to help users secure and monitor their own systems.
It incorporates various types of symmetric and assymetric encryption and features to aid in securely erasing discs etc.

The script aims to be intuitive and to do much the heavy lifting, including the ability to run quick and easy network 
and OS diagnostics including LAN and NAT address resolution as well as hardware and software specs, architectures
etc.

Finally and more as an experimant for myself, I tried to incorporate a script scanning feature, whereby using 
regular expressions, the script would scan a file, determine file type etc and look for any potentially dangerous
commands, in the case of large untrusted scripts downloaded from the internet.

Script built and tested in Kali Linux
